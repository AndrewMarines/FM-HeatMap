# FM-HeatMap

THE CODE IS STILL RAW. I'M GONNA UPDATE IT WHEN I HAVE TIME.
HOW CAN YOU USE IT RIGHT NOW?
This script use python and some libraries.
Delete all the pngs inside the dir  "Movimenti".
Open main.py
  Line 45 you'll see ImageGrab. x,y,w,h are the pixels of the desktop(FOOTBALL MANAGER NEEDS TO BE ON TOP OF EVERYTHING) the script is gonna take the screenshot at. 
  Run it and watch if the pngs the program created is fine(dir "Movimenti"). If it's not okay take a screenshot of all your desktop(with fm on top), open it on paint and find the pixels you gotta cover.
  Right now the code will take screenshot every t. seconds. If you want a full match, the code is already working if you select speed 10x.
  If you want just a part of the game my tip is to stop the code yourself.
  After you've done that at line 54 there's "screenshot()". If you already have all the movements you need write before all in that line # . Example #screenshot()
  If you run it now, it will give you the heatmap. WATCH OUT, IF YOU WANT THE FULL MATCH YOU GOTTA ROTATE HALF OF THE PNGS THE CODE CREATED(DO IT MANUALLY FROM WINDOWS)
